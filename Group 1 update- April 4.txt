Group 1 Questions: April 2, 2017
We met to discuss how to go about building our Twitterbot in a way that allows us to do more than retweeting. We would like to somehow quantify the mentions in summary-type tweets but are unsure about the code to do this. 
How do we get Twitterbot to say how many people have used a certain hashtag each day or hour?

(For example, “#InfiniteKusama was tweeted X times today”)

How do we get it to do something other than retweet? (Such as sum up data?)


Is it possible to track different rooms within the exhibition? Such as see who is mentioning the tiles of which room and how frequently? Could we do this through tracking several mentions?

How would we automate these items in a script?
