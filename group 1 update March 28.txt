March 28 update from Group 1 on Twitterbot Project

1. How will you store the data?

		Excel files

2. Have you thought about how often you'll check for tweets?

		Twice a week (this might change depending on data we are getting)

3. Are there other things you can do with this data, based on what's available via the Twitter API?

		Look at frequency of hashtag, how usage increases or decreases (or does neither)
		Look at which pieces are mentioned the most

Other thoughts:

Goals/Ideas for what we can track/ consider:
See which (infinity)rooms of exhibition are featured the most in tweets
Track mentions of “tickets” or “passes” in order to think about availability / crowding issues
Track mentions of "Hirshhorn" or @hirshhorn

Question for Derek: Is there a way to track photos with tweets w/Twitterbot?
